Directions:

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil. The piece of foil should be big enough to fold over and seal the fish.
In a small bowl, add lemon juice, garlic, and melted butter. Whisk everything together.
Place salmon on prepared baking sheet.
Pour the butter mixture over the salmon.
Season with salt, pepper, oregano, and red pepper flakes.
Fold the sides of the foil over the salmon. Make sure it is well sealed so the sauce does not leak.
Place into oven and bake until cooked for about 20-25 minutes*.
Open the foil and broil the fish for 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the fish!
Remove from the oven. Using a spoon, pour some of the butter sauce left in the foil onto the salmon before serve. Then, garnish with parsley.
Serve it with veggies, salad, rice or quinoa.
